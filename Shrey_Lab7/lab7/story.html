    <h1>The Origins of the Cheeselord</h1>
    <main>
        <p>
            The origins of my arrival into this world can be traced back to tales being told millenia ago,
            however, though each generation believes they have their own cheeselord, I am in fact the one and only true cheese lord.
            Like I said in my biography, my mother's humanitarian views from her time at the concession stand and my fathers Wisconsinian heritage have created a perfect storm for me.
            I am the Cheeselord.

            Honestly, I am over talking about cheese, it's pretty disgusting. I'm actually lactose intolerant so don't ask why I'm talking about cheese but I'll share a really quick story.
            When I was in middle school, the Cicadas came out and were literally all over the place, like on trees, cars, the ground... it was gross! But there were so many of them that they were easier to access than my LEGOs which my parents would hide.
            Anyways, one day my neighbors and I were just playing in the streets in our neighborhood and riding our bikes and just chilling. While one of my friends was riding his bike, I picked up one of the thousands of cicadas off the ground by their wings
            and threw them like an airplane at my friend and it landed right on his chest and he started screaming and rolling around and crying.
